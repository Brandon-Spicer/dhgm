      <p>Dunamis Harvest Global Ministry is an international evangelical
        organization dedicated to proclaiming the good news of Jesus Christ and
        demonstrating His love to His people with the power of Holy Spirit. We
        work primarily in Asia within areas characterized by poverty, spiritual
        darkness, and suffering. We would like to share our ministry and bring
        to life the vision we have for the people of God.</p>

  <div class="width spacing">
    <h3 class="center-text small-spacing-bottom">Our Beliefs</h3>
    <h4 class="all-caps">I. The Scriptures</h4>
    <p>We believe that the Holy Bible is God’s word, and it contains the means of our salvation. It reveals the principles by which God judges us; and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of divine revelation. </p>
    <h4 class="text-space-h4 all-caps">II. God</h4>
    <p>We believe that there is only one God, who is all powerful and all knowing. As creations of God, we owe Him our love, reverence, and obedience. </p>
    <h4 class="text-space-h4 all-caps">III. Salvation</h4>
    <p>We believe that salvation is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and there is no salvation apart from personal faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. </p>
    <h4 class="text-space-h4 all-caps">IV. The Church</h4>
    <p>We believe that the church is the body of Christ. In our congregation, each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as Lord. Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture. </p>
    <h4 class="text-space-h4 all-caps">V. Evangelicalism and Missions</h4>
    <p>It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations. The new birth of man's spirit by God's Holy Spirit means the birth of love for others. Missionary effort on the part of all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life, and is expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ has commanded the preaching of the gospel to all nations. It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by verbal witness undergirded by a Christian lifestyle, and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ. </p>
